# Vocabulary (Foreign words learning method)

This README describes not only the program, but whole method,
which I have developed for myself and use almost every day.  
Do You ever heard about the cards method of learning words? 
I hope my interpretation of this method will help to save some time 
and trees.  

## How it works (briefly)

At first, work with materials in the language you study (books, articles, 
videos). Every word, which meaning or pronunciation You don't know 
have to be written in the special workbook. It will be your own study 
dictionary. If you don't have such a dictionary yet don't worry: the 
program can make a new one for you on the base of file template.xlsx.
Of course, You need some other application to work with workbooks 
depending on your OS (Microsoft Office, LibreOffice Calc etc.). 
But I hope, it will not be a big problem. When you have array of new words
in your dictionary big enough to start learn it, You can finally use that 
program. It will make You to remember all of new words deeply without any
big efforts, suffering or drill from your side. Approximately 15 minutes of 
every day using that program can increase your vocabulary on several thousands
of new words. And using foreign language will become for You a simple routine,
not a hard challenge. Let's look at this process in detail.
